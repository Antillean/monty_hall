A simple Python script/program that runs simulations of [the Monty Hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) in parallel.

You can just run it with `python monty_hall.py`. That runs 1,000 simulations.

You can specify the number of simulations by doing something like `python monty_hall.py -n 10**6`.
